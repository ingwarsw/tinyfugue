                      TinyFugue for UNIX-like systems
		            (including MacOS X)


Installing TinyFugue
--------------------

TinyFugue should work on any Unix-like system that has an ANSI compiler
and BSD-style select().  This includes almost everything except some old
SVr3-like systems which either do not have select(), or have a select()
that works only on STREAMS devices but not terminals.

Installing TinyFugue is quite easy on most Unix-like systems.
In the top directory, execute these commands:
  ./configure
  make install
The configure script will attempt to figure out everything it needs to
know about your system and install all files in their proper location.
If you have any problems, or want to change a default installation
option, be sure to read the rest of this file.


In addition to the usual GNU configure options, TinyFugue's configure script
has these options:

  --enable-version        insert version number into name of tf executable
                          and library directory (implies --enable-symlink)
  --enable-symlink[=NAME] make a symlink NAME to the executable [PREFIX/bin/tf]
  --disable-ssl           disable SSL support
  --enable-inet6          enable IPv6 support (may be broken)
  --disable-netdb         disable hostname resolution
  --disable-termcap       use hardcoded vt100 codes instead of termcap
  --enable-termcap=LIB    enable termcap with library LIB (e.g., ncurses)
                          (needed only if configure guesses incorrectly)
  --disable-mailcheck     disable mail checking
  --enable-mailcheck=DIR  enable checking for mail in directory DIR
                          (needed only if configure guesses incorrectly)
  --enable-strip          strip debugging symbols from executable
  --enable-core           enable core files, enable debugging symbols in the
                          executable (-g), and disable optimization (-O)
  --disable-history       disable /recall and other history features
  --disable-process       disable /quote and /repeat
  --disable-float         disable floating point arithmetic and functions
  --with-incdirs=DIRS     search for include files in DIRS
  --with-libdirs=DIRS     search for libraries in DIRS
  --with-inclibdirs=DIRS  same as --with-incdirs=DIRS --with-libdirs=DIRS
  --with-inclibpfx=DIRS   same, but appends '/include' and '/lib'

For a complete list of options, run "./configure --help".

The following environment variables are meaningful to configure.  Their
default values are listed in brackets after the description.  They can
be set on the command line like this:
  env CPPFLAGS=-I/my/include ./configure

  CC		C compiler ["gcc" or "cc"]
  CFLAGS	Options for C compiler ["-g -O2" or "-O2" for gcc,
		"-g" for others]
  CPPFLAGS	Options for C preprocessor (e.g. -I) [""]
  LIBS		"-l" and "-L" options for the linker (in addition to the ones
		determined automatically by configure).

Example:
If your system has SSL libraries and headers installed in
/usr/local/SSL/{lib,include}, use the "--with-inclibpfx=/usr/local/SSL"
option with configure.


File Locations
--------------

If you do not define the file prefix with ./configure --prefix=PREFIX,
configure will choose a prefix:

   "/usr/local" if you can write to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share;
   otherwise, $HOME.

The executable is installed in ${bindir}; the macro libraries are installed
in ${datadir}.  These can be modified with the standard configure options
--bindir, --datadir, and --prefix.

If --enable-version is given, the tf executable and library directory will
have a version number embedded in their names (e.g., PREFIX/bin/tf-50a1 and
PREFIX/lib/tf-50a1-lib).  This is useful if you want to keep old versions
around.  To create a symlink from "tf" to the actual executable, use
--enable-symlink (this is not implied by --enable-version, as in earlier
releases).

There is no man page for tf.  For basic usage options, run "tf -?".  For
more information, use "/help" within tf.

If you move or rename any files after installing (this includes copying
TF to another machine where the file paths are different), you must let
TF know.  To do this without reinstalling, you can set the environment variable
TFLIBDIR to the new path before running tf, or run tf with the -L option.
This can be done with a shell script like this:

    #! /bin/sh
    exec /new/location/bin/tf -L"/new/location/lib/tf-lib" "$@"

The variables TFHELP and TFLIBRARY can also be set in the environment,
but this should not normally be necessary, since their default values are
based on TFLIBDIR.

If you want build tf for installation in one directory ("{FINAL}"), but you
want to be able to test it by installing it in another directory ("{TEMP}")
first, do:
    ./configure --prefix={FINAL}
    make
    env prefix={TEMP} make -e install
Then, you can test tf by running
    {TEMP}/bin/tf -L{TEMP}/lib
When you are satisfied it works, do
    make install
to install tf in {FINAL}.


Public Installation
-------------------

If you have write permission in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib, TinyFugue
will be installed there by default.  Or you can change the locations by using
the options described above.  The Makefile will then put all files in their
proper location with the proper permissions.

Some features of TF can be disabled for secure public installation, by using
the /restrict commands in %{TFLIBDIR}/local.tf.  See ../README.


Terminal Handling
-----------------

On a UNIX-like system, ./configure will try to find a termcap-compatible library
in this order: the one specified in --enable-termcap=LIB, if any; termcap;
ncurses; curses.  If none of those work, tf will use hardcoded vt100 codes.
On CYGWIN, tf will use hardcoded ANSI codes.


Installation Problems
---------------------

The ./configure script can usually figure out everything it needs to
know to configure TinyFugue for your unix-like system.  But if it fails
because your system is brain damaged, you may need to change some environment
variables or disable some features.


Problem: On MacOS X, configure fails with the message "configure: error:
  C compiler cannot create executables".  Also, config.log contains the
  message "ld: can't locate file for: -lcrt1.o".
Solution:  The file /usr/lib/crt1.o is missing from your system.  Restore it
  by reinstalling the DevTools ("Xcode Tools 1.1").  Copying the file
  from another OSX box also appears to work, but do this at your own risk.
  See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/9914

Problem: On AIX 4.1, a bug in gcc 2.8.0 causes /addworld and some operators to
  fail with an error like "% internal error: reduce: bad op 037777777703"
Solution: use a different compiler (cc or xlc) by setting the CC environment
  variable before running ./configure, or use a different version of gcc
  (2.7.2 is known to work).

Problem: On OSF/1 with gcc, compile errors involving 'sigval_t',
  'union sigval', or 'clock_id'.
Solution: use a different compiler (cc) by setting the CC environment
  variable before running ./configure.

Problem: With gcc, compile errors involving va_list or __builtin_va_alist.
Solution: use a different compiler (cc) by setting the CC environment
  variable before running ./configure.

Problem: Your system is Apollo Domain/OS.
Solution: in Config: FLAGS='-U__STDC__' (XXX this is wrong XXX)

Problem: On debian linux, undefined references to tgetent, tgetstr, tgetnum,
  tgoto, tputs.
Solution: Get an ELF termcap library, or add /usr/i486-linuxaout/bin to your
  PATH.

Problem: On DYNIX/ptx 4 or later, runtime error saying that -linet is not
  needed.  (Why do they have it if it's not needed!?)
Solution: Run ./configure, edit src/Makefile to remove "-linet"
  from the LIBS line, and run "make".

Problem: when you try to run tf, you get a message like this:
  ld.so.1: ./tf: fatal: libncurses.so.5: open failed: No such file or directory
Solution 1: set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to "/usr/local/lib"
  when running tf.
Solution 2: on SunOS, set environment variable LDFLAGS to "-R/usr/local/lib"
  when running ./configure.  On other operating systems, different options
  may be available; see "man ld" (try "-rpath /usr/local/lib").


SOCKS Proxy XXX
-----------

TF supports the SOCKS proxy server.  If your site uses SOCKS to connect
to outside hosts through a firewall (this is probably true if you use
"rtelnet" instead of "telnet"), then set SOCKS='yes' in the unix/Config file.

TF can also be made to connect through a generic proxy server by setting
the %proxy_host variable at runtime.  See "/help proxy".


Last Resort XXX
-----------

If you think TF won't compile because of a bug or incompatibility with
your system (you followed all the instructions, and it still won't work),
visit http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net or email the author at
kenkeys@users.sourceforge.net.  Please include the version
number of TF, and describe the type of system on which you are trying
to compile, or at the very least, the address of the system.  Use
"uname -a", if available, to get the system type; if not, look at the
message you see when you log in.  Also include the output of configure
and make.  If TF does compile, but has other problems, read "/help bugs"
before mailing a report.

For bug reports, questions, suggestions, etc., use the contacts above,
and please provide the following information:

    The version of TF and the operating system (type "/version" in tf).
    If tf won't compile, send the output of "./configure" and "make".
    If you have a bug or core, give me all error messages from tf.
    If you have a bug or core, tell me what you did or what happened
        before the problem, and if the problem is repeatable.
    If you have a core, do _not_ send the core file.
