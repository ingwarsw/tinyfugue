                                 OS/2 - README
                                 -------------

REQUIREMENTS TO RUN
-------------------
1...OS/2 3.0 with installed Internet Access Kit or OS/2 2.x with installed
    TCP/IP Basis Kit
2...a compiled tinyfugue-version
3...enough space on your hard-disk
4...an installed emx-runtime-package version 0.9a + emxfix6 or higher

REQUIREMENTS TO COMPILE
-----------------------
1...OS/2 3.0 with installed Internet Access Kit or OS/2 2.x with installed
    TCP/IP Basis Kit
2...the tinyfugue-sources
3...more space on your harddisk-partition
4...an installed emx-gcc-system

INSTALL
-------
1...install the emx-runtime-package (follow the instructions in emxrt.doc)
    you can get emxrt.zip from anonymous ftp.uni-stuttgart.de: 
    /pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9a
    You should set these environment-variables:
     TERMCAP...fullpath of your termcap file (e.g. "F:\EMX\ETC\TERMCAP.DAT")
     TERM......name of your terminal defined in termcap.dat(e.g."ansi-color-3")
    (In case you don't know: Try "help set" from an os/2-shell. Environment- 
     variables are set in your config.sys or by the OS/2-Command 'SET')
2...unzip the tinyfugue-package with "unzip -a...". You can delete src/*,
    if you don't want to compile tinyfugue 
3...set the followig environment-variables:
        HOME......your home directory. (.tfrc or tfrc will be searched there)
        TFLIBDIR..the full pathname of your tf-lib directory
4...setup your .tfrc-file (you can use "tfrc" for FAT-systems). Here is mine 
        as an example:

        ;; turn on visual mode
        /visual on
        ;; turn on more-prompt
        /more on
        ;; wait for key after processing /sh
        /shpause on
        ;; change working directory to my log-dir
        /lcd e:\tfdata
        ;; load worlds from $(HOME)/tiny.world
        /loadworld
        ;; macros can be redefined
        /redef on
        ;; german-redefining for easier acces of /-key
        ;;; #-key is now /
        /def -ib'#' = /input /
        ;;; alt-# is now #
        /def -ib'^@+' =/input #
        ;; load library map.tf from tf-lib
        /load map.tf

OS/2-KEYS 
--------- 
Some unix-keys have special meanings within os/2 (e.g. ctrl-P == PrintScreen
within an os/2-fullscreen-session), the os/2-version of tinyfugue comes with a
different key-binding. The used keys are listed in os2/keys.doc.

FILE tf-keys.cmd
----------------
Utility which let you press some keys and shows you the correct tinyfugue 
key-macro-string for redefining these keys.

PROBLEMS
--------
Triple-check that you are using the correct emx-runtime-dll. Emx always uses
the first emx.dll that can be found in your LIBPATH, so if you have an
outdated emx.dll in a forgotten directory mentioned in LIBPATH...

To check it, do this:
1) start an os/2-shell
2) enter "emxrev". You should get something like this:
   EMX : revision = 36
                     ^--- this means: emxfix06

   If you'll get a lower number, you are using an outdated emx.dll.

BUGS
----
please report bugs of the os/2-version to 

A.Sahlbach internet:asa@stardiv.de or 
           fidonet: Andreas Sahlbach 2:241/540.11

COMPILE 
------- 
1...Install the emx-gcc-system.
2...You need a make-program for compiling. Currently 
       dmake (gnu-version v.3.8, can be found on hobbes) and
       nmake (IBM-Toolkit 2.x)
       make  (GnuMake v.3.73)
    are supported.
3...From the tinyfugue-directory start os2make.cmd from an os/2-cmd-shell. The
    script will try to find one of the above make-programs and will produce a
    proper makefile and config.h-file in the src-directory and start the
    recompiling-process. You can give os2make some additional parameters:
       "VIDEO=ANSI"    will produce the ansi-scrolling-version (default)
       "VIDEO=TERMCAP" will produce the termcap-version without scrolling.
       "DEBUG=ON"      will produce one of the above with debug-info. The
                       scrolling-version needs an IPMD-style debugger. The
                       termcap-version can be debugged with gdb.  
       "USAGE"         for makefile-help 
       "CLEAN"         to remove object-files after linking.
