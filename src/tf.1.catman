[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mTinyFugue[24m  (also  known  as  "Fugue"  or  "TF")  is a line-based client
       designed for connecting to MUD  servers  (note:  LP,  DIKU,  and  other
       servers which use prompts require "/lp on"; see /help prompts).

       Most  of  the  [4mTF[24m  documentation is in the help file, which may be read
       online with the "/help" command.  This manual page may be  obsolete  in
       certain areas; however, the helpfile will always be up to date.

       [4mTinyFugue[24m  is  larger than most MUD clients, but has many more features
       and is much more flexible.  The goal is to provide the most functional-
       ity in a client that still maintains the user-friendliness of [4mTinytalk[24m.
       Clients with extension languages such as [4mTcltt[24m or [4mVaporTalk[24m  can  do  a
       little  more  in  certain areas, but are considerably harder to use and
       learn.  [4mTF[24m provides most of these  abilities  in  such  a  manner  that
       learning to use any one function is relatively easy.

       Because  I am continually adding new features and changing the code, [4mTF[0m
       sometimes becomes less  stable  in  a  new  release.   Versions  labled
       "alpha"  are  generally  not as well tested as "beta" versions, so they
       have the potential for more bugs.  For this reason, I leave some  older
       versions  at  the site where I distribute [4mTF[24m, which do not have all the
       current features but may have fewer bugs than the most recent  release.


[1mCOMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS[0m
       With no arguments, [4mTF[24m will try to connect to the first world defined in
       the configuration file(s).

       With a [1mworld [22margument, [4mTF[24m will try to connect to [1mworld[22m, as  defined  in
       the configuration file.  If [1mworld [22mis omitted, it will try to connect to
       the first world defined in your configuration files.

       With [1mhost [22mand [1mport [22marguments, [4mTF[24m will define a temporary world and  try
       to connect to it.  The [1mhost [22mmay be an IP number or regular name format.

       OPTIONS

       -f[4mfile[24m Load [4mfile[24m instead of $HOME/.tfrc at startup.

       -f     Do not load any personal configuration file.  The  library  will
              still be loaded.

       -l     Disable automatic login.

       -n     Do not connect to any world at startup.

       -q     Quiet login (overrides %{quiet} flag).


[1mFEATURES[0m
       Among other things, [4mTF[24m allows you to:

       Divide  the  screen into two parts, for input and output, with flexible
       handling of input (/visual mode).

       Connect to multiple worlds and switch between them.

       Wrap MUD output at the edge of the screen.

       Edit text in the input buffer.

       Recall previous commands.

       Modify key sequences used to perform editing functions.

       Bind commands to key sequences.

       Define complex macros to perform MUD tasks easily.

       Create triggers which automatically perform certain tasks when  certain
       output is received from the MUD.

       Modify  existing  macros  using  either a command format or interactive
       editing.

       Support "portals" that automatically switch from world to world.

       Hilite or color all or part of a line that matches a certain pattern.

       Gag lines that match certain patterns.

       Suppress frequently repeated text ("spamming").

       Automatically log into a character on a world.

       Send a text file to the MUD in flexible ways, or echo it locally.

       Send the output of a system command to the MUD, or echo it locally.

       Send text previously received from the MUD  to  the  MUD,  or  echo  it
       locally.

       Repeat a MUD or [4mTF[24m command a number of times.

       Do the above four things at varying intervals, or at a rapid-fire rate.

       Log a session to a file.

       Separate LP and Diku style prompts from normal output.

       Page output using a --More-- prompt.

       Recall previously received text.


[1mCONFIGURATION FILES[0m
       [4mTF[24m will attempt to read two files when starting.  The first is a public
       configuration  file  "stdlib.tf",  located  in  TFLIBDIR.   TFLIBDIR is
       defined when [4mTF[24m is installed, and is  often  /usr/local/lib/tf.lib,  or
       under  the home directory of the installer.  This library contains many
       macros and definitions essential to the correct operation of [4mTF.[0m

       Next, [4mTF[24m  will  attempt  to  read  your  personal  configuration  file,
       $HOME/.tfrc,  in  which  you  can put any [4mTF[24m commands you want executed
       automatically at startup.  Two of the most useful commands to use in  a
       [4mTF[24m configuration file are /addworld and /load.

       For  backward compatability, [4mTF[24m will also try to read the [4mTinyTalk[24m con-
       figuration file.  Its name  defautls  to  $HOME/.tinytalk,  or  can  be
       defined by the TINYTALK environment variable.  This file may start with
       a list of worlds that will be defined as if with /addworld.


[1mHISTORY[0m
       Anton Rang (Tarrant) in February of 1990 released [4mTinytalk[24m,  the  first
       Tinyclient  with  any  great number of features, including hiliting and
       suppression of text, simple triggers, and separating input  and  output
       on  the screen.  Leo Plotkin (Grod) made rather extensive modifications
       to [4mTinytalk[24m to produce [4mTinywar,[24m which was  plagued  with  some  serious
       bugs  and  was  never  officially released (the phrase "Tinywar doesn't
       exist" is often quoted), and is now an unsupported  client.   [4mTF[24m  began
       when  Greg  Hudson  (Explorer_Bob)  merged  many of the new features of
       [4mTinywar[24m back into [4mTinyTalk,[24m and added many new  features  of  his  own,
       most notably the split screen.  Some of the code in Greg's releases was
       contributed by Leo Plotkin.  After Greg moved on to [4mVaporTalk,[24m Ken Keys
       (Hawkeye) took over design and maintenance of [4mTF[24m in July 1991, and con-
       tinues to make improvements in features and performance.

       The code size of [4mTF[24m has surpassed 300K (unstripped),  and  is  signifi-
       gantly larger than [4mTinytalk.[24m  It is, in fact, more than three times the
       size of a number of existing servers.  As of version  3.0,  it  has  66
       builtin  commands and 57 library commands, each documented in the help-
       file.

       It has been stated that [4mTF[24m is the most-used client  in  MUDdom  at  the
       current time.  I haven't taken a poll, but I wouldn't be surprised.


[1mREVIEWS[0m
       [4mTF[24m  has significantly changed the tinyclient world.  It has a number of
       merits and a number  of  flaws,  and  has  frequently  been  criticized
       (mostly  out  of  boredom; nobody takes this business too seriously) as
       having too many features and being too damn big.

            "Tinywar doesn't exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn't."  -- Coined by
       Woodlock, I believe.

            "TinyFugue  is  a work of art."  -- Binder, obviously after having
       too much to drink.

            "TinyFugue is the biggest hack since the  platform  it  was  built
       on."  -- Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid moments.

       The  New  York  Times, the Christian Science Monitor and the Washington
       Post all refused to comment.

[1mBACKWARD INCOMPATIBILTIES[0m
       VERSION 3.2

       /rand has been replaced with rand().  Color names can no longer be user
       defined (but color codes still can).  The "=" operator does comparison,
       not assignment.

       VERSION 3.1

       Added type argument to WORLD and LOGIN hooks.

       VERSION 3.0

       Backslashes in macros are interpreted slightly differently than in pre-
       vious versions.  Turning on the "backslash" flag will  enable  the  old
       behavior.

       VERSION 2.1

       The  CONNECT hook is now called before the LOGIN hook.  In 2.0, CONNECT
       was called after autologin.

       VERSION 2.0

       In versions prior to 2.0, <space> was used to  scroll  the  pager;  2.0
       uses <tab> as the default, to allow the pager to be nonblocking.

       [4mTinytalk[24m style name gags and hilites are no longer supported.  You must
       use the '*' wildcard explicitly, as in '/hilite hawkeye*'.

       [4mTinytalk[24m style page and whisper hilites are no longer supported.   How-
       ever,  /hilite_page  and  /hilite_whisper  macros  are  provided in the
       default macro library.

       The .tinytalk file may not  be  supported  in  the  future;  use  .tfrc
       instead.

       The  '-' command line option in versions prior to 2.0 is no longer sup-
       ported, and has been replaced with '-l'.


[1mBUGS[0m
       When unterbamfing, the old connection should not be  closed  until  the
       new connection succeeds.

       If  a  shell  quote  (/quote !) reads a partial line from the pipe, the
       read will block until the rest of the line is read.


[1mWARNINGS[0m
       The Surgeon General has determined that MUDding can be  detrimental  to
       your GPA.
