<!--"@/sys"-->
<h1>/sys</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/sys.html">/SYS</a> <i>shell-command</i><br>
<hr>

<p>
  Executes <i>shell-command</i>.  The command is executed without a tty, so
  it should have no input, and its output, if any, should be plain text.  The
  command's stdout and stderr are echoed to tf's output window.
  <a href="../commands/sys.html">/sys</a> differs from
  <a href="../commands/sh.html">/sh</a> in that
  <a href="../commands/sys.html">/sys</a> can not do an interactive shell
  command, but does not redraw the screen or produce any extra messages.

<p>
  Note: calling <a href="../commands/sys.html">/sys</a> with arguments from a
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> is dangerous.  If not
  written carefully, such a <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>
  could allow anyone with access to the server to gain access to your shell
  account.

<p>
  The return value of <a href="../commands/sys.html">/sys</a> is the exit
  status of the shell if it exited normally, -1 otherwise.  Note that UNIX
  shell commands usually return 0 for success and nonzero for failure,
  which is the opposite of the TF convention.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/sys.html">/sys</a> executes synchronously.  To execute
  a command asynchronously (in the background), use
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> without the -S option.
  
<p>
  See: <a href="../commands/sh.html">/sh</a>,
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a>
