<h1>/grab</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/grab.html">/GRAB</a> <i>text</i><br>
<hr>

<p>
  This command puts <i>text</i> into the input buffer.  It is not really
  useful from the normal command line, but is quite useful when called from a
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> to redefine
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>, or perhaps when bound to a key
  to speed up part of a line (<a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>
  allow you to largely do what this would allow, however).  Any text already
  in the input buffer is discarded.

<p>
  Example:
<pre>
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> reedit = <a href="../commands/grab.html">/grab</a> <a href="../commands/edit.html">/edit</a> <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a> = $<a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a>
</pre>
  If you had previously done "<code><a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>
  flail = :flails at his keyboard</code>", the command "<code>/reedit
  flail</code>" would place "<code><a href="../commands/edit.html">/edit</a>
  flail = :flails at his keyboard</code>" in the input buffer and allow you
  to edit it using the editing keys.  See
  "<a href="../topics/evaluation.html">evaluation</a>" for details on how
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> like this work.

<p>
  See: <a href="../commands/input.html">/input</a>,
