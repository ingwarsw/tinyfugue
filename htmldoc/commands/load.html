<h1>/load</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/LOAD</a> [-q] <i>file</i><br>
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/REQUIRE</a> [-q] <i>file</i><br>
  <br>
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/LOADED</a> <i>token</i><br>
<hr>

<p>
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/Load</a> and
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/require</a>
  both read and execute commands from <i>file</i>.
  They are identical, except that if <i>file</i> calls
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loaded</a> and has
  already been read once, <a href="../commands/load.html">/require</a>
  will not read it again (but the LOAD
  message/<a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>
  will still be displayed/called).

<p>
  "<code><a href="../commands/load.html">/Loaded</a> <i>token</i></code>"
  should be the first command in a file that is designed to be loaded only
  once with <a href="../commands/load.html">/require</a>.
  <i>Token</i> should be a string that does not contain space or
  <a href="../topics/patterns.html#glob">glob</a> metacharacters, and
  is different than the token used by any other 
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loaded</a> call.
  The file's full name is usually a good choice for <i>token</i>.

<p>
  <a href="../topics/options.html">Options:</a>
  <dl>
  <dt>-q
        <dd>Do not echo the "% Loading commands from <i>file</i>" message
        in this <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> call or any
        <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> calls in <i>file</i>.
        (but the <a href="../topics/hooks.html#LOAD">LOAD hook</a> will still
        be called).
  </dl>

<p>
  The file may contain any legal TinyFugue commands.  Blank lines and lines
  beginning with ';' or '#' are ignored.  Any leading whitespace on a line is
  stripped.  Any line ending in '\' will have the following line joined to
  it (after leading spaces are stripped).  A '%' preceding a '\' eliminates
  its special meaning.

<p>
  The <i>file</i> name is expanded as described under
  "<a href="../topics/filenames.html">filenames</a>".

<p>
  If the
  <a href="../topics/library.html#compression">COMPRESS_SUFFIX</a> and
  <a href="../topics/library.html#compression">COMPRESS_READ</a>
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> are defined, the file will be
  automatically uncompressed if needed.

<p>
  If the expanded filename is not an absolute path name, TF will search first
  in the current directory (which can be changed with
  <a href="../commands/lcd.html">/lcd</a>), and then in the list of
  directories named by
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%TFPATH">%{TFPATH}</a>.
  If <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%TFPATH">%{TFPATH}</a> is
  blank or unset, the single directory named by
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%TFLIBDIR">%{TFLIBDIR}</a> is used.

<p>
  A <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> may be aborted early with
  the <a href="../commands/exit.html">/exit</a> command in the file.

<p>
  Loaded files may be given any name, but names ending in ".tf" are
  recommended.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/Load</a> and
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/require</a> return 1 if successful
  (for <a href="../commands/load.html">/require</a>, this includes not
  needing to read the file), or 0 if not successful.
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/Loaded</a> does not return if the file
  that calls it has already been loaded.

<p>
  The standard <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> library also defines
  the commands <a href="../commands/load.html">/loaddef</a>,
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadbind</a>,
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadhilite</a>,
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadgag</a>,
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadtrig</a>,
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadhook</a>, and
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/loadworld</a>.
  These <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> will load from a
  <a href="../topics/library.html#filename macros">default file</a>
  if no file is specified.
