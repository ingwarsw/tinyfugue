<h1>/suspend</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/suspend.html">/SUSPEND</a><br>
<hr>

<p>
  Suspends the TF process, if your system and shell support job control.
  This has the same effect as typing ^Z on most UNIX-like systems.
  When TF is resumed, it redraws the screen and processes all 
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> and
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> commands that
  were scheduled to run while TF was suspended and
  processes all text that was received while TF was suspended.

  <a href="../commands/signal.html">/signal</a>.
