<h1>/more</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/more.html">/MORE</a> [OFF|ON]<br>
<hr>

<p>
  Sets the value of the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%more">%{more}</a> flag.  If the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%more">%{more}</a> flag is ON when
  the screen or output window fills up, output will stop, and a
  "More" prompt will be displayed.
  With the default keybindings,
  TAB will scroll one screenful,
  PgDn and PgUp will scroll a half screen forward or backward,
  ^[^N and ^[^P will scroll one line forward or backward,
  and ^[j will Jump to the last screenful.

<p>
  Regardless of the setting of the 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%more">%more</a> flag, you can
  use "<code><a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> pause</code>" (^S)
  at any time to pause the screen immediately, or use any of the scrolling
  commands to scroll backward and forward.  After doing so, the "more"
  prompt will remain until you reach the bottom line again; after that point,
  newly displayed lines will obey the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%more">%more</a> flag normally.

<p>
  In <a href="../topics/mode.html">visual mode</a>,
  with the default <a href="../topics/status_line">status bar</a> settings,
  the More prompt displays the number of old lines (i.e., how far you have
  scrolled backwards) and the number of new lines you haven't had a chance to
  see yet (i.e. lines that arrived since the More prompt first appeared).
  If you have not scrolled backwards, only the count of new lines is shown,
  so the More prompt looks the same as it would have in version 4.0.
  If either count would not fit in the space allotted to it in the More prompt,
  they may be displayed in units of thousands (e.g., "17523" would be shown as
  "17k").

<p>
  Each <a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a>
  and open world <a href="../topics/world.html">world</a>
  has its own window with its own "more" state.

<p>
  If your terminal can't scroll in
  <a href="../topics/mode.html">visual mode</a>, TF will start over at the top
  of the output window instead.

<p>
  See: <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a>,
