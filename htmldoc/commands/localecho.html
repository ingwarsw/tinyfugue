<h1>/localecho</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/LOCALECHO</a> [ON|OFF]<br>
<hr>

<p>
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/Localecho</a> with no arguments
  returns 1 if local echoing is enabled for the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current socket</a>, 0 otherwise.
  TF echoes its input by default, unless the server has negotiated otherwise.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/Localecho</a> with an argument
  attempts to enable or disable echoing for the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current socket</a>.
  If the server is not known to support TELNET protocol,
  "<a href="../commands/localecho.html">/localecho</a> [ON|OFF]" does nothing,
  and returns 0.
  ON tells the server DONT ECHO; if the server acknowledges (as it must
  according to TELNET protocol), tf will echo its own input.
  OFF tells the server to DO ECHO; if the server acknowledges,
  tf will not echo its own input, expecting the server to do it.
  The actual change of state takes place after the server agrees, which
  may be delayed by network latency ("netlag").

<p>
  Note that tf does not transmit input until a newline is pressed, and
  the server can not echo it until it is received; so, with
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/localecho</a> off,
  your typing will not be visible until you hit return, at which
  time the server may echo back the entire line.

<p>
  Some mud servers use the ECHO option to disable local echo during password
  entry.  Telnet servers, however, try to disable local echo for the entire
  session, which would interfere with many useful tf features.  Hooks
  defined in the <a href="../topics/library.html">standard library</a> use
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/localecho</a> to
  override the telnet server automatically.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/Localecho</a> is intended to be
  called by library macros, and should not need to be called by the user.
  <a href="../commands/localecho.html">/Localecho</a> obsoletes %{always_echo}.

<p>
  The TELNET ECHO option is defined in RFC 857.

  See: <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>,
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%prompts">%telopt</a>,
  <a href="../commands/telnet.html">/telnet</a>
