<h1>/help</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/help.html">/HELP</a> [<i>topic</i>]<br>
<hr>

<p>
  Displays help on the topic specified, or displays a quick summary of
  available topics if no topic is given.

<p>
  In the documentation,
  words or phrases in <a href="#">this format</a> are references to other
  topics.  That is, a hyperlink in HTML, or something that can be used
  as an argument to <a href="../commands/def.html">/help</a> in <b>tf</b>.

<p>
  Commands are described with the format "/COMMAND arguments".
  Words in all caps must be spelled exactly as shown
  (but do not need to be capitalized).
  Arguments in <i>this format</i>
  (underlined angle brackets in /help, or italics in HTML)
  can be given any value.
  Arguments in [square brackets] may be omitted.
  The character | means "or".
  For example, "[OFF|ON]" means you may type "off", "on", or nothing.

<p>
  Some help topics have punctuation in their names:  variables begin with
  "%", commands begin with "/", and functions end with "()".  A name with
  omitted punctuation will usually match the same topic (e.g.,
  "<a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>" and
  "<a href="../commands/def.html">def</a>"
  both match the /def command topic), but sometime will
  match a different topic (e.g.,
  "<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%MAIL">%MAIL</a>"
  matches the MAIL variable topic, but
  "<a href="../topics/hooks.html#MAIL">MAIL</a>"
  matches the MAIL hook topic).
  There are also (sub)topics for various tf syntax constructions such as
  "<a href="../topics/substitution.html#%{}">%{}</a>" and
  "<a href="../topics/substitution.html#$()">$()</a>".

<p>
  For <a href="../commands/def.html">/help</a> to work,
  the <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%TFHELP">%TFHELP</a>
  must contain the name of the helpfile.  It is set when TF is installed, and
  should not normally be changed.  If the helpfile or the help index is not
  found, <a href="../commands/help.html">/help</a> will not function.
  The help file is in ASCII with embedded ANSI display codes, so can be
  read or printed by any program that can handle ANSI codes.
