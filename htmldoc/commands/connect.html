<h1>/connect</h1>

<p>
  Usage:

<p>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/CONNECT</a> [-lqxbf] [<i>world</i>]<br>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/CONNECT</a> <i>host</i> <i>port</i><br>
<hr>

<p>
  In the first form, <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a>
  attempts to open a <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> connected to
  <i>world</i>.  <i>World</i> must be defined by the
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a> command and not already
  open.  If <i>world</i> is omitted, the first defined world will be
  used.
  If <i>world</i> does not have a host and port,
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> will
  create a "connectionless" <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.
  In the form
  "<a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> <i>host</i>
  <i>port</i>", it will define a temporary world named
  "<code>(unnamed<i>N</i>)</code>" with the given address, and try
  to connect to it.
  <i>Host</i> may be an internet hostname,
  an <a href="../topics/protocols.html">IPv4</a> address,
  or (if your platform supports it)
  an <a href="../topics/protocols.html">IPv6</a> address.
  A temporary world will be undefined when it is no longer in use.

<p>
  <a href="../topics/options.html">Options:</a>
  <dl compact>
  <dt>-l
          <dd>No <a href="../topics/login.html">automatic login</a>
          (i.e., don't call the <a href="../topics/login.html">LOGIN</a>
          <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>).
  <dt>-q
          <dd>Quiet login (overrides
          <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%quiet">%{quiet}</a>
          flag).
  <dt>-x
          <dd>Connect using SSL (not necessary if
          <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> was defined with the
	  "x" flag).
  <dt>-f
          <dd>Connect in the foreground
  <dt>-b
          <dd>Connect in the background
  </dl>

<p>
  The first thing <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> does is
  create a new <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.
  If the -f option was given, or <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a>
  was called from the foreground (e.g., from the command line), the new
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is immediately brought into
  the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>.
  If the -b option was given, or <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a>
  was called from the background (e.g., from a DISCONNECT
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> in a
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#background">background</a> world), the
  connection proceeds in the background.
  
<p>
  If a hostname was given, TF must look it up to find one or more
  <a href="../topics/protocols.html">IPv4</a> 
  or (if your platform supports it)
  <a href="../topics/protocols.html">IPv6</a> addresses.
  If
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%gethostbyname">%{gethostbyname}</a>
  is "nonblocking" (the default), and this process takes more than a fraction
  of a second,
  TF will print "Hostname resolution for <i>world</i> in progress" (the PENDING
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>), and TF will continue running
  normally while the lookup proceeds.
  But if
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%gethostbyname">%{gethostbyname}</a>
  is "blocking", TF will freeze until the lookup is finished.
  Either way, if the lookup
  succeeds, TF will try to connect; if it fails, you will be notified.

<p>
  Next, TF tries to open a network connection to the IP address, and prints
  "Trying to connect to <i>world</i>: <i>address</i> <i>port</i>"
  (the PENDING hook).
  On most platforms, if 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%connect">%{connect}</a> is
  "nonblocking" (the default), TF continues running normally while
  the network connection proceeds.
  But if <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%connect">%{connect}</a> is
  "blocking", TF will freeze until the network connection is finished.
  If the connection succeeds, a message is printed, but (unlike previous
  versions of TF) the <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>
  is not automatically brought to the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>.
  However, if you had run <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a>
  in the foreground (e.g. from the command line),
  the <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> would already be in the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>,
  unless it was nonblocking and had taken a long time and you
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foregrounded</a> another
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> while you were waiting,
  in which case you probably wouldn't want to automatically
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a> the new
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.
  If you prefer automatic
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foregrounding</a> upon
  successful connection, you can <a href="../commands/def.html">define</a> a
  CONNECT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> that calls
  "<code><a href="../commands/fg.html">/fg</a> 
  <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%1">%{1}</a></code>".

<p>
  Even if 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%gethostbyname">%{gethostbyname}</a>
  and/or <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%connect">%{connect}</a> are
  "blocking", they can be interrupted with the SIGINT
  <a href="../topics/signals.html">signal</a> (^C).

<p>
  If the connection fails, TF normally prints
  "Connection to <i>world</i> failed: <i>address</i> <i>port</i>: <i>reason</i>"
  (the CONFAIL <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>).
  But, if the failure was in the specific address, and there is more than one
  address associated with the <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a>'s
  hostname, the message will instead say
  "Intermediate connection to <i>world</i> failed: ..."
  (the ICONFAIL <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>),
  and TF will try to connect to the next address.
  So, a failed <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> will always
  result in a series of zero or more
  ICONFAIL <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a>
  followed by exactly one CONFAIL <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>.
  But an ICONFAIL may also be followed by a successful connection to an
  alternate address.

<p>
  If the network connection is successful, or the 
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is "connectionless",
  these events occur:
<ul>
  <li>If the <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> was defined with an
    <i>mfile</i>, that file will be loaded
    (and the LOAD <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> will be called);
  <li>The CONNECT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is called
    (unless the socket is connectionless
    or the connection is via a <a href="../topics/proxy.html">proxy</a>).
  <li>If <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%login">%{login}</a> is on,
    and a character and password is defined for the
    <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a>, the LOGIN
    <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is called
    (unless the socket is connectionless
    or the connection is via a <a href="../topics/proxy.html">proxy</a>).
    The default LOGIN
    <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a> sends the character name and
    password in a format corresponding to the world type.  To automatically
    login to a world that expects a different login format, define your own
    LOGIN <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>.
</ul>

<p>
  If you have trouble connecting (especially if you use SOCKS),
  try "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%connect">connect</a>=blocking</code>".

<p>
  If your host has multiple network interfaces, the OS will choose one of
  them for the client end of the connection according to its own rules.
  To override the system's choice, set the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%tfhost">tfhost</a> variable
  or define the <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a> with a
  <i>srchost</i> parameter to
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">addworld</a>.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> returns 0 on error or
  failure, 1 for immediate success, or 2 if the name lookup or network
  connection is pending.
