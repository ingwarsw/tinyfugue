<p>
  A Builtin Command is any of the commands listed under
  "<a href="../commands/">commands</a>".  All builtin commands start with
  "/".  All builtins have a return value, usually nonzero for success and 0
  for failure.

<p>
  A <a href="../topics/macros.html">Macro</a> Command is a user-defined
  command.  <a href="../topics/macros.html">Macro</a> commands also start
  with '/'.  The return value of a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a>
  is the return value of its body when executed.

<p>
<a name="/!"></a>
<a name="/@"></a>
<a name="/#"></a>
<a name="/"></a>
  A command starting with a single "/" is either
  a <a href="../topics/macros.html">Macro</a> Command or
  a <a href="../commands/index.html">Builtin</a> Command.
  If the "/" is followed by "!", the return value of the command will be
  negated.
  If the "/" or "/!" is followed by "@", the rest of the word is interpreted
  as the name of a <a href="../commands/index.html">Builtin</a> Command.
  If the "/" or "/!" is followed by "#", the rest of the word is interpreted
  as the number of a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a>.
  If neither "@" nor "#" is used (the normal case), the rest of the word is
  interpreted as a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> if there is one
  with that name, otherwise it is interpreted as the name of a
  <a href="../commands/index.html">Builtin Command</a>.
  If the name does not match any <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> or 
  <a href="../commands/index.html">Builtin Command</a>,
  the <a href="../topics/hooks.html#NOMACRO">NOMACRO</a>
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is called.

<p>
  A Simple Command is any command that does not start with "/".  The text of
  such a command is sent directly to the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a> world, if there is one.
  The return value of a simple command is 1 if the text is successfully sent to
  the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a> world, otherwise 0.
  To send a line that starts with "/" without having it interpreted as a
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">Macro</a> Command or
  <a href="../commands/index.html">Builtin</a> Command,
  use a leading "//"; the first "/" will be stripped.

<p>
  A Compound Command is one of
  <a href="../commands/if.html">/IF</a>...<a href="../commands/if.html">/ENDIF</a>
  or
  <a href="../commands/while.html">/WHILE</a>...<a href="../commands/while.html">/DONE</a>.
  These are described under separate help sections.  Their return value is
  that of the last command executed.

<p>
  A List is a sequence of commands separated by
  "<a href="../topics/substitution.html#%;">%;</a>" (separator) or
  "<a href="../topics/evaluation.html">%|</a>" (pipe) tokens.
  The commands are executed in sequence, but may be aborted early
  with the <a href="../commands/return.html">/RETURN</a>
  or <a href="../commands/break.html">/BREAK</a> commands.
  and the return value of the List is
  the return value of the last command executed in the sequence.
  An empty List has a return value of 1.

<p>
  Two commands separated by "<a href="../topics/evaluation.html">%|</a>"
  pipe token mentioned above will have the output stream
  (<a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a>) of the first connected to
  the input stream (<a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a>) of the second.
  The first command runs to completion before the second command begins;
  the second command should stop reading <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a>
  when it becomes empty.
  Simple Commands have no <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a> or
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a>, so they may not be piped.
  The <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a> of a Compound Command may
  not be piped directly, but the output of a macro that contains a
  Compound Command may be piped.

<p>
  Some characters within a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> body
  undergo substitution.  These special characters are not interpreted as
  themselves, but cause some evaluation to be performed, and the result
  substituted in place of these characters.  This is described under
  "<a href="../topics/substitution.html">substitution</a>".

<p>
<a name="scope"></a>
<a name="dynamic scope"></a> When an
  <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expansion</a> begins, a new scope is
  created.  Any local <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> created
  during the <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expansion</a> will be placed
  in this new scope.  The scope and all
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> in it are destroyed when
  the <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expansion</a> exits.

<p>
  Any <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> reference will refer to
  the <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> with that name in the
  nearest enclosing (i.e., most recently created) still existing scope.  This
  is called "dynamic scope".

<p>
  Lexical scope can be simulated to some extent by using
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  substitutions with the correct number of "%"s instead of
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  references.  (Remember, a "reference" uses the name by itself in an
  <a href="../topics/expressions.html">expression</a>, like
  <code>"<a href="../commands/test.html">/test</a> foo</code>"; a
  "substitution" uses "%" characters, like
  "<code><a href="../commands/test.html">/test</a> %foo</code>").
