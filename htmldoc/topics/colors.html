<h1>colors</h1>

<p>
  Color is enabled by default.  To disable it, use "/color_off"; to re-enable
  color using ANSI codes, use "/color_on".
  
<p>
  The color <a href="../topics/attributes.html">attribute</a>
  allows you to specify a foreground color with "C<i>name</i>"
  or a background color with "Cbg<i>name</i>".
  Any terminal that supports color should support the 8 basic colors:
  <span style="color: black">black</span> (black),
  <span style="color: red">red</span>,
  <span style="color: green">green</span>,
  <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>,
  <span style="color: blue">blue</span>,
  <span style="color: magenta">magenta</span>,
  <span style="color: cyan">cyan</span>,
  <span style="color: white">white</span> (white).
  (If you are reading this in tf, and the previous sentence did not contain
  colored words, you do not have working color support.
  If it contained strange codes, you should do
  "/color_off" or redefine the codes as described below.)
  The standard library defines these 8 basic colors with ANSI control codes,
  which will work on most terminals that support color.

<p>
  Many terminals also support brighter versions of the 8 basic colors, but
  may need to be configured to do so.  On xterm, you may want
  to disable the "boldColors" resource so that bold plus a normal color
  does not produce one of these bright colors.
  The bright color names are:
  gray,
  brightred,
  brightgreen,
  brightyellow,
  brightblue,
  brightmagenta,
  brightcyan, or
  brightwhite.
  The standard library defines these 8 bright colors with ISO 6429 extension
  control codes, which will work on most terminals that support 16 colors.

<p>
  Some newer terminals can display 256 colors.  If tf was built
  with the "256colors" <a href="../commands/features.html">feature</a>,
  tf will recognize the following additional color names.
  Names names of the form "rgb<i>R</i><i>G</i><i>B</i>" describe a color
  within a 6x6x6 color cube:  <i>R</i>, <i>G</i> and <i>B</i> are each a
  single digit between 0 and 5 that specifies the brightness of the
  red, green, or blue component of the color.
  For example, "rgb020" is a dark green, and "rgb520" is reddish orange.
  Names of the form "gray<i>N</i>" describe a point on a grayscale, where
  <i>N</i> is between 0 (dark) and 23 (light).
  The standard library defines the "rgb*" and "gray*" colors with
  xterm 256 color extension control codes.

<p>
  To test the functionality and appearance of colors in tf, you can
  "<code><a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> testcolor.tf".
  This will also show the
  <i>R</i>, <i>G</i> and <i>B</i> values of each color.

<p>
  You can use a defined color in any
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">attribute</a> string.  For example, to
  make <a href="../commands/hilite.html">/hilite</a>'d text appear blue, you
  can <code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%hiliteattr">hiliteattr</a>=Cblue</code>.

<p>
  To define your own control codes for terminals that don't accept the
  predefined codes,
  you will need to edit the color
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a>.
  The code to enable foreground or background color <i>name</i> is stored in a 
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> called
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%start_color_name">%{start_color_<i>name</i>}</a> or
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%start_color_name">%{start_color_bg<i>name</i>}</a>.
  The code to turn off colors is stored in
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%end_color">%{end_color}</a>.
  These <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> may contain carat
  notation and backslashed ascii codes in
  decimal, octal, or hexadecimal (e.g., ESC is ^[, \27, \033, or \0x1B).

<p>
  The default definition of
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%end_color">%end_color</a>
  is <code>"\033[39;49;0m</code>", which should work on most ANSI-like
  terminals.  If this does not work on your terminal, then try
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%end_color">end_color</a>
  \033[30;47;0m</code>" (for black on white) or
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%end_color">end_color</a>
  \033[37;40;0m</code>" (for white on black).

<p>
  If <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%emulation">%{emulation}</a> is
  set to "ansi_attr" (the default), then ANSI, ISO 6429, and xterm 256 color
  extension codes sent by the server will be interpreted by
  tf.  As a result, if the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%start_color_name">%{start_color_<i>name</i>}</a>
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> are set correctly for
  your terminal, tf will translate color codes from the server into codes
  for your terminal, displaying them correctly even if your
  terminal does not use the same codes the server sends.  See:
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%emulation">%emulation</a>.

<p>
  Note for "screen(1)" users:  to make 8-16 colors work under Screen, you
  need the following screenrc settings:
  <pre>
    termcap  xterm AF=\E[3%dm
    terminfo xterm AF=\E[3%p1%dm
    termcap  xterm AB=\E[4%dm
    terminfo xterm AB=\E[4%p1%dm
  </pre>
  To make 256 colors work under Screen, it must have been compiled with
  "--enable-colors256", and you need the following screenrc settings:
  <pre>
    terminfo xterm Co=256
    termcap  xterm Co=256
    termcap  xterm AF=\E[38;5;%dm
    terminfo xterm AF=\E[38;5;%p1%dm
    termcap  xterm AB=\E[48;5;%dm
    terminfo xterm AB=\E[48;5;%p1%dm
  </pre>

<p>
  Colors are numbered 0 through 255 in the order in which they are
  described above, but refering to colors by their enumeration number is
  generally not recommended, as the numbering is subject to change.
  In particular, the numbering and interpretation of background colors
  changed in version 5.0 beta 7.
