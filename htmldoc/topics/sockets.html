  A <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is a world-in-use,
  including a network connection (usually) and a virtual window for displaying
  text.
  TF can have multiple <a href="../topics/sockets.html">sockets</a>
  open simultaneously.  Only one of these can be displayed at a time; this is
  called the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.  In
  <a href="../topics/mode.html">visual mode</a>, the name of the world on the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is displayed on the
  <a href="../topics/status_line.html">status line</a>.
  Other <a href="../topics/sockets.html">sockets</a> are in the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#background">background</a>.
  Text from any <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>ed and stored in
  <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a> immediately, but is not
  displayed until that <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is brought
  into the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>.
  Handling of events in
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#background">background</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">sockets</a> can be customized with the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%bg_output">%{bg_output}</a> and
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%background">%{background}</a>
  flags.

<p>
  The <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> to which commands are sent.
  The <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> is almost always
  the same as the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a> <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>,
  except: 1) when a <a href="../topics/macro.html">macro</a> is
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">triggered</a>
  from any <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>, that
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> becomes the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> for the duration of that
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> execution; 2) when a
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> or
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> with world redirection runs (-w
  option), that world's <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> becomes
  the <a href="../topics/sockets.html#current">current</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> for the duration of
  the <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a> execution.

<p>
<a name="">
  Text from a <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> goes through a
  number of checks before being displayed.  If the text matches any
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> patterns, a
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> may be executed, or the text
  may be <a href="../topics/attributes.html">gag</a>ged or
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">hilite</a>d.  If the text was not
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">gag</a>ged, TF also checks to see if it
  should be suppressed because of
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%quiet">%quiet</a>,
  <a href="../commands/watchdog.html">/watchdog</a> or
  <a href="../commands/watchname.html">/watchname</a>.  Finally, the text is
  added to the world's <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a> and
  the global <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a>, and is
  queued for display.

<p>
  You can open a new <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> in several
  ways:
<ul>
  <li>By giving the world name or address on the command line when
      <a href="../topics/tf.html">starting tf</a>.
  <li>By using a <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> or
      <a href="../commands/world.html">/world</a> command.
  <li>By "<a href="../commands/bamf.html">bamfing</a>" through a portal
  between muds (see "<a href="../commands/bamf.html">bamf</a>").
</ul>

<p>
  You can switch between
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">sockets</a> with
  the <a href="../commands/fg.html">/fg</a> command;
  the <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> socketb
  and <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> socketf
  commands, which by default are <a href="../topics/keybindings.html">bound</a>
  to ESC-left and ESC-right;
  and with the ESC-w <a href="../topics/keybindings.html">keybinding</a>,
  which switches to the next world with activity, or if there is none,
  to the last world you were on.

<p>
  If the <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%quitdone">%{quitdone}</a>
  flag is on, and you disconnect from all worlds (either with
  <a href="../commands/dc.html">/dc</a> or because the other end of the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>'s network connection closes),
  TF will exit.

<p>
  If the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%sockmload">%{sockmload}</a> flag
  is on, a world's <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> file will be
  loaded when you switch to the <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>
  for that world (either with the next and previous
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a> keys or with the
  <a href="../commands/world.html">/world</a> command).

<p>
  TF supports several TELNET options; see
  <a href="../commands/telnet.html">telnet</a>.

<p>
  If <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%proxy_host">%{proxy_host}</a>
  is defined, all connections will go through a
  <a href="../topics/proxy.html">proxy</a> server.  See:
  <a href="../topics/proxy.html">proxy</a>.

<p>
  Normally, certain types of disconnection can only be detected when
  you try to send something on a connection.  TF uses the socket option
  SO_KEEPALIVE to detect such disconnections even when idle, but it usually
  takes at least 2 hours to detect.  The time limit is usually a property
  of the operating system, and can not be set by TF or an unprivileged user.

<a name="loopback">
<a name="connectionless">
<a name="connectionless socket">
<p>
  A "connectionless" socket is created when you 
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> to a
  <a href="../topics/worlds.html">world</a>
  that does not have a host or port defined.
  If the world also has the echo flag set,
  any text you "send" to the socket is immediately "received",
  as if you were connected to an echo server.
