<h1>introduction</h1>

<p>
  TinyFugue is a MUD client.  It helps you connect to a MUD, in a much more
  convenient manner than telnet.  You can connect to a mud world using the
  same syntax as you would with telnet: "<a href="../topics/tf.html">tf</a>
  <i>host</i> <i>port</i>".  Or, while running tf, you can use
  "<a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> <i>host</i> <i>port</i>".
  To make things easier, you can give names to worlds, using
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a>, and then use
  "<a href="../topics/tf.html">tf</a> <i>name</i>" and
  "<a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> <i>name</i>".  If you
  store a set of <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a> commands
  in a file, TF can read them automatically when it starts.  You can even
  connect to more than one world at the same time, and switch between them.
  See: <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a>,
  <a href="../commands/fg.html">/fg</a>,
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a>,
  <a href="../topics/worlds.html">worlds</a>,
  <a href="../topics/tfrc.html">tfrc</a>.

<p>
  Normally, TF will split the screen into two windows: one for input,
  and one for output.  TF will display useful information on the line
  separating the two windows, such as the name of the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a> world.
  See: <a href="../topics/mode.html">windows</a>.

<p>
  Any line you type that starts with a single '/' is a tf command.  Anything
  else you type will be sent to the mud.  See:
  <a href="../topics/interface.html">interface</a>,
  <a href="../commands/">commands</a>.

<p>
  You can define your own tf commands, called
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>.  The simplest type of
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> is just an abbreviation or alias
  for a longer command or commands.  But
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> can also perform much more
  powerful tasks.  See: <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>,
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>.

<p>
  You can tell tf to watch for certain patterns in the text from the mud, and
  then do special things when it sees that pattern: display the text in a
  special way (<a href="../topics/attributes.html">hilite</a>); not display
  the text at all (<a href="../topics/attributes.html">gag</a>); execute a
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> command
  (<a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>); or do any combination of
  these.  See: <a href="../topics/attributes.html">attributes</a>,
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">triggers</a>,
  <a href="../commands/hilite.html">/hilite</a>,
  <a href="../commands/gag.html">/gag</a>,
  <a href="../commands/trig.html">/trig</a>,
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>.

<p>
  TF keeps a <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a> of every line it
  prints, every line sent by the mud, and every command you enter.  You can
  see those histories using <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a>.
  You can also have this text saved in a file using
  <a href="../commands/log.html">/log</a>.  See:
  <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a>,
  <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a>,
  <a href="../commands/log.html">/log</a>.
