<h1>problems</h1>

<p>
  If you have an old version of TF, chances are your bug has already been
  fixed.  Current information and the latest version of TF can be found at
  <a href="http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/">http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/</a>.

<p>
  For general bug reports, questions, etc, visit the website above (preferred),
  or email kenkeys@users.sourceforge.net.  For
  problems specific to the OS/2 version, contact Andreas Sahlbach at
  asa@stardiv.de.  When reporting a problem or bug, please provide this
  information:

<ul>
<li>The full version number of TF (type
    "<a href="../commands/version.html">/version</a>" in tf).
    Please give the <em>full</em> number, don't just say something like
    "beta 4" or "the latest version".
<li>The operating system name and version.  (On unix systems, type
    "<code>uname -a</code>" in the shell to get the exact version information.)
<li>If tf won't install, send the output of the installation process (on UNIX,
    that's the output of configure and make).  Don't leave out parts just
    because you don't know what they mean or think they're irrelevant.
<li>If you have a bug or core:  do NOT send the core file, but do send
    the debugging dump file (tf.<i>NNNNN</i>.dump) if tf generated one.
    If not, give me ALL messages from tf (not just the last line).
    In either case, tell me what you did or what happened before the problem,
    and whether the problem is repeatable.
<li>Optional:  If you have a core, you know how to use a debugger,
    tf was compiled with core dumps enabled, and tf did not generate a
    debugging dump file, a manual stack
    trace would be useful (use the 'bt full' command in gdb or 'where' in dbx).
    If you
    don't know how, at least provide the other information described above.
</ul>

<p>
<a name=""></a> The following bugs are known.  Don't bother reporting them.
<ul>

<li>
  The <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a> and
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%emulation">%{emulation}</a>
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> should work on a
  per-<a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>
  basis (This is partially overcome with WORLD
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a>).

<li>
  If a shell quote (<a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> !) reads a
  partial line from the child process, tf will hang until the line is
  completed.

<li>
  <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a> by timestamp doesn't work
  when switching to/from daylight savings time (but
  <a href="../commands/recall.html">/recall</a> by age always works).

</ul>
