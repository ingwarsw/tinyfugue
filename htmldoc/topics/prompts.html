<h1>prompts</h1>

<p>
  Most LP muds, Diku muds, telnetd, and some other types of servers
  send unterminated <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>, that is,
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>
  that do not end with newline or any other special character.
  Normally, TF will not display text
  until a newline is received, so you may not see the
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a> until after you
  press return.  But if the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a> flag is on, TF will
  attempt to separate these <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>
  from normal text and display them correctly.

<p>
  The recommended way to use the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a> flag is to define
  your worlds with one of the
  <a href="../commands/addworldtype.html">/addlp</a>,
  <a href="../commands/addworldtype.html">/adddiku</a>, or
  <a href="../commands/addworldtype.html">/addtelnet</a> commands.  The
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a> flag will be turned
  on automatically when you switch to such a world, and turned off for the
  other predefined world types.  See:
  <a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a>.

<p>
  TF also provides a PROMPT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>, which
  allows you to tell it what to look for in a
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>.  When an unterminated
  line is received, the PROMPT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> is
  called immediately.  If there is no match, TF will use the timeout method
  described below (if <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a>
  is on).  But if there is a matching PROMPT
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>, TF will forget about the line
  (unless the hook was defined with
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>
  <a href="../commands/def.html#-q">-q</a>)
  and let the <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> deal with it.  By
  combining the PROMPT <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a> with the
  <a href="../commands/prompt.html">/prompt</a> command, you can recognize
  most <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a> immediately without
  having to use the <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a>
  timing mechanism.  The typical way of doing this is:
<pre>
    <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> -h"PROMPT *&gt; " catch_prompt = <a href="../commands/test.html">/test</a> <a href="../commands/prompt.html">prompt</a>(<a href="../topics/substitution.html#%*">{*}</a>)
</pre>
  So, whenever TF receives an unterminated line that ends in "&gt; ",
  catch_prompt will see it, and use
  <a href="../commands/prompt.html">/prompt</a> to copy it to the current
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>.

<p>
  If an unterminated line is not matched by any PROMPT
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hook</a>, and it is not followed by more
  text within a short period of time, TF will assume it is a
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>.  This
  method is not foolproof.  If the delay is too short, broken lines will look
  like <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>, and will briefly
  appear in the input window until the rest of
  the line arrives, at which time both parts of the line will be printed as
  normal output.  If the delay is too long, there will be an annoying delay
  before displaying real <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>.

<p>
  The delay can be varied by setting the
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%prompt_wait">prompt_wait</a>.
  Its default value is 0.25 seconds.

<p>
  All of this hackery can be avoided if the server sends unambiguous
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>.
  TF will recognize "*\b" (that is, "*" followed by backspace) and anything
  ending with
  <a href="../topics/prompt_protocol.html">GOAHEAD</a> or
  <a href="../topics/prompt_protocol.html">END-OF-RECORD</a>
  telnet characters.  When TF sees
  such text, it does not wait for a delay, but calls the PROMPT hook
  immediately; if there is no match, TF displays the prompt immediately.
  To avoid some minor glitches, you
  should leave the <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lp">%{lp}</a>
  flag off when connected to such a server.  If you are responsible for a
  server and wish to make it more TF-friendly, see
  "<a href="../topics/prompt_protocol.html">prompt protocol</a>".
