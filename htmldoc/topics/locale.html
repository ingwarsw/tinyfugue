<p>
  <!-- This is what most people are looking for, so put this first. -->
  On many systems, "<code><a href="../commands/setenv.html">/setenv</a>
  LC_CTYPE=en_US</code>" will allow you to use characters in the 8-bit ISO 8859
  character set.  If this does not work on your system, or you want to use a
  non-English locale, or you just want to learn more, keep reading.

<p>
  A locale defines a set of rules for a language and culture.  If the
  platform on which TF runs supports locales, TF will support the following
  categories of locale rules:

  <dl>
  <dt>LC_CTYPE	<dd>determines what characters are allowed, and whether
		they should be treated as letters, digits, puctuation, or
		control characters.  When using a locale with an 8-bit
		character set, make sure that 
		<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%istrip">%istrip</a>
		is <code>off</code> and
		<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%meta">%meta_esc</a>
		is <code>off</code> or <code>nonprint</code>,
		so you can type 8-bit characters with the meta key.
  <dt>LC_TIME	<dd>determines the names and formats used in displaying
		dates and times with
		<a href="../commands/time.html">/time</a>,
		<a href="../commands/ftime.html">ftime()</a>, etc.
  </dl>

<p>
  The user can set the locale either by having special variables defined in
  the environment before starting TF (preferred), or by setting them
  while TF is running (they will automatically be exported to the environment
  even if <a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a> is used).
  The exact rules for setting locale depend on the platform, and should be
  found your system's documentation for setlocale().
  The rules are usually something like this:

  <ol>
  <li>If the variable
	<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%LC_ALL">LC_ALL</a> is set,
	its value is used as the locale for all supported categories.
  <li>Otherwise, if the variable with the name of a category (e.g., LC_CTYPE)
	is set, its value is used as the locale for that category.
  <li>Otherwise, if the variable
	<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%LANG">LANG</a> is set,
	its value is used as the locale for any supported categories
	that were not covered by the first two rules.
  <li>If none of those are set for a category, the default "C" locale is
	used for that category, which allows the 7-bit ASCII character
	set and US English date and time formats.
  </ol>

<p>
  The valid values for the locale variables depend on your system.
  On a POSIX system, the valid values can be listed with the shell command
  "<code>locale -a</code>".

<p>
  Bugs:
  <ul>
  <li>LC_COLLATE and LC_MESSAGES categories are not supported.
  <li>In glob <a href="../topics/patterns.html">patterns</a>,
      there is no way to specify a range of all letters that works in
      all locales.  E.g., "[A-Za-z]" works in the standard "C" locale,
      but not necessarily in others.
      (However, in regexp <a href="../topics/patterns.html">patterns</a>,
      locale information <b>is</b> used to define character type operators
      like "\w" and "\W", case insensitivity, etc.)
  <li>TF will convert character 0x80 to the character 0x00.  This is not
      usually an issue, since character 0x80 is not a printable character in
      the character sets of most locales (including all ISO character sets).
  </ul>

<p>
  If your system has locale support, but does not have any locales installed,
  you can get the POSIX 1003.2 WG15-collection locale definitions from
  <a href="ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/">ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/</a> or
  <a href="ftp://i44ftp.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/linux/ctype/">ftp://i44ftp.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/linux/ctype/</a>.

<p>
  Note that even though TF supports locales with non-ASCII character sets,
  not all MUD servers support non-ASCII character sets.  Many servers simply
  discard characters that are not printable ASCII.  Among servers that do
  support non-ASCII characters, the most commonly used set is ISO-8859-1
  (Latin1).  When choosing a locale for TF, you should choose one that
  uses the same character set as the servers you use.

<p>
  Note to linux users and other users of GNU libc:
  at least some versions of GNU localedef generate invalid LC_TIME
  information from the WG15-collection sources, and the GNU libc causes
  any program that tries to use the invalid LC_TIME information to crash.  
  Workarounds:  delete the LC_TIME data; or, do not set any of the
  LC_ALL, LC_TIME, or LANG variables.
