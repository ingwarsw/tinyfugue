<p>
  The <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> and
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> commands in Fugue are done by
  setting up internal <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a> that
  run concurrently with normal input and output.

<p>
  <a href="../commands/ps.html">/ps</a> can be used to get a listing of the
  currently running <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a> and
  their process ID's (for use with <a href="../commands/kill.html">/kill</a>).

<p>
  <a href="../commands/kill.html">/kill</a> can be used to terminate a
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a>.

<p>
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">Processes</a> can be either synchronous or
  asynchronous.  Synchronous <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a>
  (started with the -S option)
  run immediately when they are started, and run to completion (unless
  TF is <a href="../topics/signals.html">interrupted</a>)
  before any other commands are executed.  Synchronous
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a> are new in version 3.3
  beta 10.

<p>
  Asynchronous <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a>
  are merely scheduled to be run by a
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> or
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> command; the actual execution
  occurs at some later time.  They can be run based on two different
  criteria:

<p>
  1.  Normally, <a href="../topics/processes.html">processes</a>
  run whenever a specific period of time has
  elapsed.  The delay can be specified when the
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a> is started, or will
  default to the value of 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%ptime">%{ptime}</a>.

<p>
  2.  If the
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%lpquote">%{lpquote}</a> flag is
  on or the <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a>
  was started with the -P option,
  a <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a>
  run whenever a <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a> is received
  from the server, indicating that the previous command has completed.
  If the process was started with a -w option, only prompts from the specified
  world will trigger its execution.
  Example:
<pre>
	<a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> -P <a href="../commands/send.html">/send</a> `/_echo n%; /_echo w%; /_echo w%; /_echo s
</pre>
  will send the commands "n", "w", "w", and "s", waiting between each one
  until the <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a> following
  the previous command is seen.

<p>
  If an asynchronous <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> or
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> is followed immediately by
  another command, the other command will run first, because the asynchronous
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a>
  was only scheduled, not actually executed (even with -n or -0 options).
  Use a synchronous
  <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> or
  <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> to force the
  <a href="../topics/processes.html">process</a> to run
  before any other commands.

<p>
  Bodies of <a href="../commands/repeat.html">/repeat</a> undergo
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> body
  <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expansion</a> when they are executed;
  text generated by <a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote</a> does not.
