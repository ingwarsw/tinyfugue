<p>
  Some hints and style tips:

<p>
  <ul>
  <li> Use a high-<a href="../topics/priority.html">priority</a>
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> on
  yourself to prevent loops.  Say I want to throw a tomato at anyone who says
  the word "tomato", and I write the following
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>:
<pre>
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> -t"*tomato*" tomato = :throws a tomato at <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a>.
</pre>
  If Ben uses the word tomato, I will
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>, and then see the text
  "Hawkeye throws a tomato at Ben." That text contains the word tomato, which
  will <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> me again, creating an
  infinite loop.  One way to prevent this is by creating a
  high-<a href="../topics/priority.html">priority</a>
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> on myself which does nothing:
<pre>
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> -p99999 -t"{Hawkeye|You}*" anti_loop
</pre>
  Now, when I see "Hawkeye throws a tomato at Ben", the /anti_loop
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a> will catch it before /tomato
  does, so I won't loop.

<p>
  <li> Use multiple lines, spacing, and indentation in
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> files.  Normally, commands must
  be on one line.  But in files read with
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a>, if a line ends in '\', the
  following line will have leading whitespace stripped and the two lines will
  be joined.  This makes it much easier (for humans) to read complex
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>.  Compare the two identical
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> below, and see which is easier
  to read.

<p>
<pre>
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> count=<a href="../commands/let.html">/let</a> i=1%;<a href="../commands/while.html">/while</a> (i&lt;=<a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a>) say %i%;<a href="../commands/let.html">/let</a> i=$[i+1]%;<a href="../commands/while.html">/done</a>
</pre>

<p>
<pre>
  <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> count = \
      <a href="../commands/let.html">/let</a> i=1%; \
      <a href="../commands/while.html">/while</a> ( i &lt;= <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a> ) \
	  say %i%; \
	  <a href="../commands/let.html">/let</a> i=$[i + 1]%; \
      <a href="../commands/while.html">/done</a>
</pre>

<p>
  <li> Use comments in <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> files.
  Complicated <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> are much easier to
  read if you include a short comment describing the arguments to the
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> and what it does.  Lines
  beginning with ';' or '#' are comments, and are ignored during
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a>.

<p>
  <li> Name all <a href="../topics/triggers.html">triggers</a> and
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a>.  If you ever need to
  <a href="../commands/load.html">/load</a> a file a second time,
  <a href="../topics/triggers.html">triggers</a>,
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">hilite</a>s,
  <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a>, and
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">gag</a>s without names may be
  duplicated.  But if they are named, old copies of
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> will be replaced with new copies
  of <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> with the same name.  Naming
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> also makes them easier to
  manipulate with commands like
  <a href="../commands/list.html">/list</a> and
  <a href="../commands/undef.html">/undef</a>.

<p>
  <li> Don't use "weird" characters in
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> names.  Although any
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> name is legal, some characters
  can have unwanted <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expansion</a>
  effects.  Weird characters are also harder to read.  You should stick to
  letters, numbers, and '_' characters.  In particular, avoid '~' characters,
  since they are used in library <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a>.

<p>
  <li> Use local <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> instead of
  global <a href="../topics/variables.html">variables</a> if possible.  This
  avoids conflicts when two <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> use a
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> with the same name.
  If you're using a
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> in an
  <a href="../topics/expressions.html">expression</a>,
  use <a href="../commands/let.html">/let</a> first to initialize the
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> in the local scope.
  But remember, when you use a <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  reference (by name, as opposed to a
  <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> substitution using "%"), TF
  uses dynamic scoping (see: <a href="../topics/scope.html">scope</a>).

<p>
  <li> Use <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a> references
  instead of %-substitutions
  in <a href="../topics/expressions.html">expressions</a>.
  Because <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a> bodies
  are <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">expanded</a>, something like
  "<a href="../commands/test.html">/test</a>
  <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a>" is prone to problems if
  <a href="../topics/substitution.html#%n">%1</a> contains any special
  characters.  But by using a <a href="../topics/variables.html">variable</a>
  reference you can avoid this problem;
  for example, "<code><a href="../commands/test.html">/test</a> {1}</code>".

<p><li>
  "<a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%pedantic">pedantic</a>=on" to
  make tf generate warnings about some potential problems.

<p><li>
  "<a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%defcompile">defcompile</a>=on" to
  see syntax errors in a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a>
  when you define it, instead of waiting until you first run it.

<p><li>
  "<a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%mecho">mecho</a>=on" to
  see what commands are being executed, or
  <a href="../commands/connect.html">/connect</a> to a
  normal or <a href="../topics/sockets.html#connectionless">connectionless</a>
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>
  defined with
  "<code><a href="../commands/addworld.html">/addworld</a> -e</code>"
  to see what you're sending to the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html">socket</a>.

<p><li>
  "<a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%emulation">emulation</a>=debug"
  and "<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%telopt">telopt</a>=on"
  to see exactly what the socket is sending to tf.

<p><li>
  Use the -n or -l option of <a href="../commands/trigger.html">/trigger</a>
  to see a list of <a href="../topics/triggers.html">trigger</a>
  <a href="../topics/macros.html">macros</a> that would match a given line.

  </ul>
