<h1>virtual windows</h1>

<p>
Starting in version 5.0, TF maintains a separate virtual window for each
open <a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a>, including the "(no world)"
pseudo-socket.
Normally, a window scrolls when text is written to it.
If the <a href="../commands/more.html">more</a> flag is set, automatic
scrolling will stop when the window becomes full.
You can manually scroll forwards and backwards in each 
<a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a>'s window
using the keys in the table below.

<p>
Per-socket windows make it unnecessary to finish reading the
text on one <a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a> before switching
to another.
When you bring a new <a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a> into the
<a href="../topics/socket.html#foreground">foreground</a>, the old
<a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a>'s window
is hidden, but remembers all of its text and current position; when
you return that old <a href="../topics/socket.html">socket</a> to the
<a href="../topics/socket.html#foreground">foreground</a>, the text is
redrawn at the remembered position, and you can resume
reading where you left off.
A <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%textdiv">dividing line</a>
makes it easy to find the point where the old text ends and the new
text begins.
The text of a window is also refilled after resuming from
<a href="../commands/suspend.html">/suspend</a>
or <a href="../commands/sh.html">/sh</a>, and even when the terminal's
size changes.

<p>
In the table below, the 
"<a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a>" columns indicate the argument to
the <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> command that performs the
scrolling, and the "keys" column indicates the default keystrokes that perform
the scrolling.
<pre>
    scroll       ....forward....   ...backward....
    amount       <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a>  keys      <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a>     keys
    -----------  ------- -------   ---------- ----
    normal       <a href="../commands/dokey.html#pgdn">PgDn</a>    PgDn      <a href="../commands/dokey.html#pgup">PgUp</a>       PgUp
    1/2 screen   <a href="../commands/dokey.html#hpage">hpage</a>   ^[h ^X]   <a href="../commands/dokey.html#hpageback">hpageback</a>  ^X[
    1 screen     <a href="../commands/dokey.html#page">page</a>    TAB ^X}   <a href="../commands/dokey.html#pageback">pageback</a>   ^X{
    1 line       <a href="../commands/dokey.html#line">line</a>    ^[^N      <a href="../commands/dokey.html#lineback">lineback</a>   ^[^P
</pre>
Note that the line-scrolling keys may be typable as meta-ctrl-n and meta-ctrl-p
(depending on your
<a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%meta_esc">%meta_esc</a> and
<a href="../topics/locale.html">locale</a>).
"Normal" scrolling is a full screenful by default.
If you prefer PgUp and PgDn to scroll a half screen instead,
you should redefine
<pre>
    <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> key_pgdn = /dokey_hpage
    <a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a> key_pgup = /dokey_hpageback
</pre>

<p>
Some terminal emulators do not send PgUp and PgDn keys to tf.
If you have such a terminal, you may wish to
<pre>
    <a href="../commands/bind.html">/bind</a> ^F = /dokey_page
    <a href="../commands/bind.html">/bind</a> ^B = /dokey_pageback
</pre>
If you're an emacs user, you may want to bind
<pre>
    <a href="../commands/bind.html">/bind</a> ^V = /dokey_page
    <a href="../commands/bind.html">/bind</a> ^[v = /dokey_pageback
</pre>
(or, "<code>/load kb-emacs.tf</code>").

<p>
A virtual screen can be redrawn with ^L, or cleared with ^[^L (ESC ctrl-L).
Once lines are cleared from a screen, they can be redrawn by scrolling
back to them.  They are not automatically redrawn when you hide the
screen and then unhide it again.

<p>
Some <a href="../topics/hooks.html">hooks</a> need to print messages that 
do not make sense at the bottom of the
<a href="../topics/socket.html#foreground">foreground</a>
window (as they did before
version 5.0).  For example, if you have world Foo in the
<a href="../topics/socket.html#foreground">foreground</a>,
and get activity in world Bar, it would not make sense for the
<a href="../topics/hooks.html#ACTIVITY">ACTIVITY hook</a> to print
"<code>% Activity in world Bar</code>" to Foo's window.
Firstly, you might want to know about the activity even if you are not
at the end of Foo's window buffer.
Secondly, after you read the text in Bar and returned to Foo,
the message would still be at the bottom of Foo's window buffer,
misleadingly.
Many messages of this type are now delivered as
"<a href="../topics/tfio.html">alerts</a>".
An <a href="../topics/tfio.html">alert</a> appears temporarily on the
<a href="../topics/status_line.html">status line</a>, where you can
see it immediately and it will not outlive its usefulness.
Also, because text from different worlds is not mixed in 5.0,
the <a href="../topics/hooks.html#WORLD">WORLD hook</a>
no longer prints "<code>--- World <i>name</i> ---</code>".

<p>
The <a href="../commands/limit.html">/limit</a> command will filter the text
displayed in a window.  The counters in the 
<a href="../commands/more.html">more</a>
prompt will count only the lines that match the
<a href="../commands/limit.html">limit</a>.

<p>
If your terminal emulator has its own scrollback, it probably will not
work very well with tf.  To avoid confusion and avoid polluting your
terminal's scrollback with garbage, tf tries to switch to the terminal's
"alternate buffer", which does not keep scrollback.  But not all terminals
and configurations allow this (for example, xterm does, but only if the
termcap or terminfo entry contains the correct codes, and it has not
been disabled with xterm's titeInhibit resource).  If the terminal can
not switch to an alternate buffer, the terminal's scrollback may appear
to work for a while, but will become jumbled as soon as you switch worlds
in tf or use tf's scrollback.  You are advised to not attempt to use your
terminal's scrollback at all while running tf.
