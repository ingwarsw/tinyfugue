<h1>tfio</h1>

<p>
  TF normally does its output through "streams", which are analagous to
  the streams of C stdio.

<p>
  Output from most tf commands, including
  <a href="../commands/echo.html">/echo</a>, are output to the
  "<a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a>" stream, which is normally attached
  to the screen.
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a> may be redirected
  with a <a href="../commands/quote.html">command /quote</a>,
  <a href="../topics/substitution.html#$(">$() command substitution</a>,
  or <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">%| pipe</a>.

<p>
  Many TF error messages, hook messages, and the output of
  "<a href="../commands/echo.html">/echo -e</a>" are output to the
  "<a href="../topics/tfio.html">tferr</a>" stream, which is always attached
  to the screen, and may not be redirected.

<p>
  Some TF error messages, hook messages, and the output of
  "<a href="../commands/echo.html">/echo -A</a>" are output to the
  "<a href="../topics/tfio.html">alert</a>" stream.
  In <a href="../topics/mode.html#visual">visual</a> mode,
  text sent to the alert stream is displayed briefly on the status line
  <a href="../topics/status_line.html">status line</a>, where it can be
  seen immediately even if you're at a 
  <a href="../commands/more.html">more</a> prompt.
  The duration of the alert display is determined by 
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%alert_time">%alert_time</a>.
  In <a href="../topics/mode.html#nonvisual">nonvisual</a> mode,
  text sent to the alert stream is redirected to the tferr stream.

<p>
  Text from a world or "<a href="../commands/echo.html">/echo -w</a>"
  is sent to a <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> for that world.
  Text sent to a world <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>
  will be stored in the <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a> of
  that world.  If that world is the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a> world,
  the text is sent to the screen immediately; otherwise, it will not
  be displayed until world is brought into the
  <a href="../topics/sockets.html#foreground">foreground</a>.

<p>
  Commands that read input
  (using <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a>)
  read by default from 
  "<a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a>", which is normally attached
  to the keyboard.
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a> may be redirected with
  a <a href="../topics/evaluation.html">%| pipe</a>.

<p>
  All <a href="../topics/tfio.html">streams</a> have a handle which can be
  used as an argument to the <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfio</a> functions.
  The handles for 
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin</a>,
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout</a>, and
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tferr</a>
  are "i", "o", and "e", respectively.
  The handles for <a href="../topics/tfio.html">streams</a> opened with
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen()</a> are integers.

<p>
<h2>tfopen()</h2>
  The <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen</a>(<var>name</var>,
  <var>mode</var>) function
  can be used to open arbitrary <a href="../topics/tfio.html">streams</a>.
  If called with no arguments,
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen()</a> opens
  an unnamed "q" mode <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>.
  The <i>mode</i> argument describes the usage of the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>:

<dl>
<dt>"w"	<dd>Open a file "<i>name</i>" for writing.
	Write operations will overwrite existing file contents, if any.
<dt>"a"	<dd>Open a file "<i>name</i>" for appending.
	Write operations will occur after existing file contents, if any.
<dt>"r"	<dd>Open a file "<i>name</i>" for reading.
	(see also: "<a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote '</a>").
<dt>"p"	<dd>Execute a shell command "<i>name</i>" and read its output
	(see also: "<a href="../commands/quote.html">/quote !</a>").
<dt>"q"	<dd>Open a queue for reading and writing.
	The <i>name</i> argument will appear in the output of
	<a href="../commands/liststreams.html">/liststreams</a>, but has
        no other meaning.
</dl>

  A "q" mode <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> may be thought of
  as a place to hold lines for passing between two or more commands.

<p>
  If successful,
  the <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen()</a> function
  returns a positive number which is the handle of
  the new <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>,
  which should be used in subsequent calls to
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a>,
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfwrite">tfwrite()</a>, and
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfclose">tfclose()</a>.
  If it fails,
  the <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen()</a> function
  returns -1.

<p>
  A call to <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfwrite">tfwrite()</a>
  or <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a> on a
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> opened with a mode that
  does not allow that operation will return -1.

<p>
  The <a href="../commands/liststreams.html">/liststreams</a> command will
  display a list of open <a href="../topics/tfio.html">streams</a>.

<p>
<h2>tfclose()</h2>
  When a <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> opened by
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfopen">tfopen()</a> is no longer needed,
  it should be closed with
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfclose">tfclose</a>(<var>handle</var>),
  which will flush the <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> and release
  its resources.
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfclose">tfclose()</a> can be
  used on the <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout stream</a> (handle "o")
  within a <a href="../topics/macro.html">macro</a> body
  to prevent further output from subsequent commands in that
  <a href="../topics/macro.html">macro</a> body; closing 
  the <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin stream</a> (handle "i") will
  prevent further reads; and closing
  the <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tferr stream</a> (handle "e") is
  not allowed.

<p>
<h2>tfwrite()</h2>
  The <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfwrite">tfwrite</a>(<var>handle</var>,
  <var>line</var>) function writes a <i>line</i> of text to the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> designated by <i>handle</i>.
  If <i>handle</i> is omitted, the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfout stream</a> is used (so
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfwrite">tfwrite</a>(<var>line</var>)
  is equivalent to
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#echo">echo</a>(<var>line</var>)).
  <a href="../topics/attributes.html">Display attributes</a> of <var>line</var>
  are stripped if it is written outside of tf (i.e., to a file or pipe).

<p>
  If an OS file (mode "w" or "a") is set to autoflush (the default), then
  each line written is flushed to the file immediately.  If you are writing
  a large number of lines, it is more efficient to disable autoflushing with
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfflush">tfflush</a>(<var>handle</var>,
  "off"), and manually force a flush with
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfflush">tfflush</a>(<var>handle</var>) or
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfclose">tfclose</a>(<var>handle</var>)
  after writing the large block.
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfflush">tfflush()</a> has no meaning
  on files of mode "p", "q", or "r".
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">Streams</a>
  are flushed automatically when closed.

<p>
<h2>tfread()</h2>
  The <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread</a>(<var>handle</var>,
  <var>variable</var>) function
  reads a line from the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>
  designated by <i>handle</i>.
  If <i>handle</i> is omitted, the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfin stream</a> is used.
  If successful, the line is assigned to <i>variable</i>, and 
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a> returns the
  (non-negative) length of the line.
  If <i>variable</i> did not already exist, it is created at the global level,
  as if by <a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>.
  If there are no lines available to read, or an error occurs,
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a> returns -1.
  For "r" and "p" mode <a href="../topics/tfio.html">streams</a>,
  a -1 return value indicates end-of-file; the only valid operation on the
  <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a> after that is
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfclose">tfclose()</a>.
  But for a "q" mode <a href="../topics/tfio.html">stream</a>, a -1 return
  value may just mean there are currently no lines in the queue; more lines
  may be added by <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfwrite">tfwrite()</a>,
  and then <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a> will be
  able to read them.

<p>
<h2>Keyboard Reading</h2>
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a>
  from the keyboard is special.  It can only be done from a command line
  command; trying to do it directly or indirectly from a trigger, hook,
  keybinding, or process is an error, and will make the
  <a href="../topics/functions.html#tfread">tfread()</a> return -1.
  It reads a line of input from the keyboard until the newline key is pressed
  or "<a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> newline" is executed.
  During the read, all existing
  <a href="../topics/keybindings.html">keybindings</a>
  continue to work normally.
  Any text already in the input buffer is not cleared when the read starts.
  Text entered after the read starts is appended
  to the existing text, and when the read ends,
  its result is the entire input buffer.
  Lines entered during a read are not saved in the input
  <a href="../topics/history.html">history</a> (but you can use
  "<a href="../commands/recordline.html">/recordline</a> -i" to save
  them explicitly).

<p>
  A read from the keyboard
  (and the <a href="../topics/macro.html">macro</a> that called it)
  can be interrupted with a SIGINT, normally generated by typing CTRL-C.

<p>
  During a keyboard read, if a <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a>
  calls <a href="../commands/dokey.html">/dokey</a> newline,
  the newline will not be executed immediately, but will be held until
  the rest of the commands in the <a href="../topics/macros.html">macro</a>
  are processed.
  For example, consider the keybinding
  "<code><a href="../commands/def.html">/def</a>
  <a href="../commands/def.html#-b">-b</a>'^[^M' =
  /dokey newline%; /send go</code>".  Normally, typing ^[^M would execute
  the current input buffer, then send "go" to the server.  But during a
  keyboard read, typing ^[^M would send "go" first, and then do the newline
  that completes the read.

<p>
  The library file <a href="../commands/textutil.html">textutil.tf</a> defines
  several commands that are useful with <a href="../topics/tfio.html">tfio</a>.
