<h1>prompt protocol</h1>

<p>
  TF will recognize the TELNET protocol commands GOAHEAD or END-OF-RECORD as
  the end of a <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>.  If you are
  responsible for a server that has
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>,
  and wish to make it more friendly to TF users, choose one of these options:

<p>
  GOAHEAD: Send IAC GA (\377 \371) after each
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>.  This is the easier of
  the two options.  In many servers, this can be done at the beginning of the
  routine that reads user input.  Disadvantage: could possibly cause problems
  in clients that don't understand TELNET protocol (but usually, they will
  just pass it through to the terminal, which will usually ignore it).

<p>
  END-OF-RECORD: Send IAC WILL EOR (\377 \373 \031) when the user connects.
  If the client responds with IAC DO EOR, then you can send IAC END-OF-RECORD
  (\377 \357) after each
  <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompt</a>; otherwise, do nothing special
  in <a href="../topics/prompts.html">prompts</a>.
  Disadvantage: requires extra state per descriptor and more understanding of
  telnet protocol.  Advantage: minimizes potential problems for clients that
  do not recognize telnet protocol.

<p>
  To debug telnet option negotiations, you may find it useful to
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a>
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#%telopt">telopt</a> on</code>"
  in TF.

<p>
  For more information on TELNET protocol, see RFCs 854, 855, 885, and 1123.
