<h1>experimental non-visual mode</h1>

<p>
  TF 5.0 beta 5 has a new experimental non-visual mode ("expnonvis") that
  fixes design flaws in traditional
  <a href="../topics/nonvisual.html">non-visual</a> mode.
  I may get rid of traditional non-visual mode in the future, so if
  you use it, I suggest you try expnonvis mode now and let me know
  if you don't like it.
  To enable expnonvis mode,
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a> expnonvis=on</code>" and
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a> visual=off</code>".
  You may also want to
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a> <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#kecho">kecho</a>=on</code>"
  (see below).

<p>
  In the new expnonvis mode, input is only ever visible on the bottom line.
  It scrolls your input buffer left and right as needed to display the part
  of the input buffer in the neighborhood of the cursor.  The part of the line
  that is "off the left edge" of the screen is simply not visible.
  In traditional non-visual mode, that part of the line would scroll up,
  polluting the output region with partial input lines.

<p>
  The "only on bottom line" rule applies even when you hit return to execute
  the input line.  Your input is erased, and the command is executed; it does
  not scroll up.  If you want to see the input text scroll up, you can
  "<code><a href="../commands/set.html">/set</a> <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#kecho">kecho</a>=on</code>";
  this will print the entire input, not just the last segment of it that fit
  within the screen width.  You may also want to set
  <a href="../topics/special_variables.html#kecho_attr">%kecho_attr</a>
  so that the echoed input is easily distinguishable from regular output.

<p>
  The minimum amount of scrolling is determined by the %sidescroll variable,
  which defaults to 1.  For slow terminals, you may wish to increase this.
  Any movement that would exceed half the screen width does not use the
  terminal's scrolling, but instead redraws the line.

<p>
  The current implementation probably has a few bugs; if the screen display
  ever appears incorrect, use ^R or ^L to redraw it.
  I don't think there are any fatal bugs, but it is possible that some
  remain, so don't try expnonvis unless you don't mind crashing tf.
  Terminals without the delete character capability are not yet supported,
  but will be in the future.
